Explain what markdown is and how it behaves on Gotm. Explain gotm-custom stuff.

- `<button outlined icon="download">Click me!</button>` renders an outlined button with a download icon and a label that says "Click me!". The following icons are available: download, code.
- `<game src="<studio-handle>/<game-handle>" />` embeds the game located at `https://gotm.io/<studio-handle>/<game-handle>`.
- `<row>...</row>` renders two child elements beside each other horizontally. For example `<row><button>A</button><button>B</button></row>` renders an "A" button and a "B" beside each other.
