# Content

A content is a global and persistent piece of data in a [game](game) that can be shared between [players](user). The data can be an image, a player-generated item, a game configuration file, or anything else.

Players use content to share their progress or creations in a game with other players or between devices.

[Game developers](studio) use content to change or add to the experience of a game without uploading a new [game pack](game-pack). Content is also used instead of direct filesystem operations for storing data locally on a player's device, because it is more flexible and supports fully customizable complex filtering and ordering.
