Before a player can create a custom %subject%, the game must feature an editor. Luckily, making a Godot %subject% editor is relatively easy thanks to Godot's node structure.

After a player has created a custom %subject% in the game they can share it with other players or save it locally to their device by storing it in a [Gotm content](/src/docs/content.md).

This example shows how to make custom Godot %subject%s savable and sharable. In this example a player has already created their custom %subject%, which is just a Godot node.
