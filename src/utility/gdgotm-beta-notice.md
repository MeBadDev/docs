BETA NOTICE: Currently %subject%s are beta features and are stored locally unless the game is running on Gotm, even if you have provided a project key. Using beta features is safe when using [GDGotm](/src/docs/gdgotm.md). You can enable global mode anyway with [GotmConfig](/src/docs/gdgotm/api-reference/gotmconfig).
